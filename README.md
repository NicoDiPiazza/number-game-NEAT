# number-game-NEAT
NEAT practice

A P5JS algorithm, written inside of an HTML script so that it displays to a screen and the user can see what's happening in real time. The point of the game is to guess high numbers, and the robots who say higher numbers survive, the rest die, and new ones are mutated. I fllowed the structure of Neural Evolutionary Augmenting topologies, (NEAT)
