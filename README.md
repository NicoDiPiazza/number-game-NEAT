# number-game-NEAT
NEAT practice

A P5JS (Processing JavaScript 5) algorithm, written inside of an HTML script so that it displays to a screen and the user can see what's happening in real time. The point of the game is to guess high numbers, and the robots who say higher numbers survive, the rest die, and new ones are mutated. I fllowed the structure of Neural Evolutionary Augmenting topologies (NEAT). Minimal user interface, mostly just for watching them do their thing. I created this to get familiar with the systems for future projects.
